# Enhancement 5

# Introduce a SiegeEngine Unit. The SiegeEngine is very effective against 
# buildings such as the Barracks. However, it is ineffective against other Units. 
# (It can't attack them, as if they were dead.)

# So unlike with Footman (whose attacks do a fraction of the damage they normally would,) 
# a SiegeEngine does 2Ã— damage against a Barracks.

# Also, SiegeEngines can attack other SiegeEngines even though they cannot attack 
# any other Units (such as Peasants or Footmans.)

# SiegeEngines are initialized with these stats.

# AP: 50
# HP: 400
# Cost: 200 gold, 60 lumber, 3 food
# Make note, you will need to require the seige_engine.rb file in spec_helper.rb.
